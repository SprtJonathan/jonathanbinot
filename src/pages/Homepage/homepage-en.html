      My name is Jonathan Binot, I'm <span id="age">${age}</span> year old and I
      have a degree in web development with a level of Bachelor + 2, but also a
      degree in web development with a level of Bachelor + 3 with OpenClassrooms
      <img src="${OCLogo}" height="18px" />.<br /><br />
      Since I was a child, I'm passionate about computer technology and video
      games, that's why I decided to give myself the means to work in the
      sector. Computer tech being a vast domain, there are two disciplins in
      which I would like to invest professionnaly : <br /><br />

      Motivated to achieve my goals, I started learning on my own very early,
      with my computer and the software I had at my disposal. I started with FPS
      Creator (but that part doesn't really count) then with the Half-Life²
      level editor by watching video tutorials online. As the years went by, I
      started to learn new things, by discovering Unreal Engine 3 (with UDK)
      then Unreal Engine 4. Motivé pour atteindre mes objectifs, j'ai commencé
      très tôt à apprendre en autodidacte, avec mon ordinateur et les logiciels
      de développement à ma disposition. J'ai commencé sur FPS Creator (mais
      cette partie là ne compte pas vraiment) puis avec l'éditeur de niveaux de
      Half-Life² en regardant des tutoriels vidéo en ligne.
      <br /><br />More recently, I found a passion for virtual reality and I was
      finally able to invest in quality equipment thanks to the job I had found.
      Finally, with the release of Half-Life: Alyx in VR as well as its
      development tools, I discovered the development on Source² Engine (which
      has strong similarities with its predecessor from 2003) this time and I
      Also discovered the basics of virtual reality development on Unreal Engine
      4 and the basics of the Unity engine less than a month ago. <br /><br />I
      really enjoy learning new techniques, and discovering all that is possible
      to do with modern game engines.

      <br />
      <br />

      As for web development, I discovered this discipline during my first year
      of university at the Mathematics-Computer Science high school of Lyon.
      Unfortunately, I did not like the way the university worked and the
      mathematics course we were learning, but the teaching unit "Introduction
      to networks and web dev" really interested me. Thanks to this, I
      discovered the potential of HTML and CSS and after a year as an employee
      in the family arcade room "La Tête dans les Nuages", I set myself the goal
      of creating a personal website on which would be my resume and a showcase
      of my achievements in the form of a portfolio. I started to learn on my
      own again thanks to the free Openclassrooms lessons in particular.
      <br />

      Today you are on the home page of this website, and if you have taken the
      time to read this text, I thank you and I hope you understand my
      determination to achieve my goals through the work-study program.
