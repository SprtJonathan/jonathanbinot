        <span class="description-gaming">During my free time, I really enjoy discovering how games are made behind the scenes. That's why I spend time, apart from gaming, to manipulate and discover game dev tools of some of the games I play. I learned to use Unreal 4 by myself with Youtube tutorials, but also how to use the Source Engine (1 and 2) from Valve.<br>
        I don't really have a full project to show, however, I'm on a constant learning process. Here you can see some examples of my work.</span>

            <div class="content">
                <p class="description-video">The Source² engine, although very new, shares many aspects of its predecessor, on which I have spent a lot of time over the past few years, learning Level Design techniques. I enjoyed going back on it and deepening my basics. It is a tool that I find very pleasant to use. <br>
                The following example is a map for the game Half-Life Alyx that I have been working on for a month. I continue my engine learning process as I progress on the geometry of the map. I learned to use some of the tools built into the engine:
                <br> - Tile Meshing: 3D models programmed to form user-defined paths (e.g. pipes to walls, air ducts etc.)
                <br> - 3D Skyboxes: use of an external map in order to "project" it on the current map in order to optimize the render of the 3D models by increasing their size.
                <br> - Scripted Sequences (Entities allowing to script character animations in order to make them perform a defined action)
                <br> - Dynamic lighting

                    <p class="description-video">This one shows scripted sequences. The creature (a <i>headcrab</i>) that comes from behind the pillar is "called" by and entity that makes it spawn on the map, and another entity named "scripted sequence" makes it do the animation I chose. Once this animation is done, the default AI of the NPC takes the control back.</p>

                    <p class="description-video">Another example of a scripted sequence. Here, the <i>zombie</i> (the name of these NPCs in the Half-Life franchise) has an idle animation set (it is pointing the light with its finger). Once the player touches a trigger I placed in the map, the animation of the pointing stops and the <i>zombie</i> has to walk to the second scripted sequence. When he arrives at the second entity, an output of this entity makes it go <i>ragdoll</i> (its body is free of animation) and once he drops to the ground, another output sets its health points to 0.</p>

                    <p class="description-video">The last example of a scripted sequence. This time, the when the player approaches the door, a <i>trigger</i> triggers the soldiers walk as well as the radio sound that plays behind the door.</p>

While I was concentrating on level design with the Source Engine, the UE4 allowed me to learn how to code and what was the logic behind simple programs thanks to the blueprints visual coding system. By following some online courses, I learnt how to create a small 3D platform game (Knuckles Strike), that according to the images, looks like a strange joke. <br>More recently, I started to learn how to create VR projects in UE4. I'm only starting to scratch the surface, but I progress every day, and I learn fast.</p>
